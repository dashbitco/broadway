defmodule Broadway.Producer do
  @moduledoc """
  A Broadway producer is a `GenStage` producer that emits
  `Broadway.Message` structs as events.

  The `Broadway.Producer` is declared in a Broadway topology
  via the `:module` option (see `Broadway.start_link/2`):

      producer: [
        module: {MyProducer, options}
      ]

  Once declared, `MyProducer` is expected to implement and
  behave as a `GenStage` producer. When Broadway starts,
  the `c:GenStage.init/1` callback will be invoked directly with the
  given `options`.

  ## Injected Broadway configuration

  If `options` is a keyword list, Broadway injects a `:broadway` option
  into the keyword list. This option contains the configuration for the
  complete Broadway topology (see `Broadway.start_link/2`). For example,
  you can use `options[:broadway][:name]` to uniquely identify the topology.

  The `:broadway` configuration also has an `:index` key. This
  is the index of the producer in its supervision tree (starting
  from `0`). This allows features such as having even producers
  connect to some server while odd producers connect to another.

  If `options` is any other term, it is passed as is to the `c:GenStage.init/1`
  callback. All other functions behave precisely as in `GenStage`
  with the requirements that all emitted events must be `Broadway.Message`
  structs.

  ## Optional callbacks

  A `Broadway.Producer` can implement two optional Broadway callbacks,
  `c:prepare_for_start/2` and `c:prepare_for_draining/1`, which are useful
  for booting up and shutting down Broadway topologies respectively.

  ## Producing Broadway messages

  You should generally modify `Broadway.Message` structs by using the functions
  in the `Broadway.Message` module. However, if you are implementing your
  own producer, you **can manipulate** some of the struct's fields directly.

  These fields are:

    * `:data` (required) - the data of the message. Even though the function
      `Broadway.Message.put_data/2` exists, when creating a `%Broadway.Message{}`
      struct from scratch you will have to pass in the `:data` field directly.

    * `:acknowledger` (required) - the acknowledger of the message, of type
      `t:Broadway.Message.acknowledger/0`.

    * `:metadata` (optional) - metadata about the message that your producer
      can attach to the message. This is useful when you want to add some metadata
      to messages, and document it for users to use in their pipelines.

  For example, a producer could create a message by doing something like this:

      %Broadway.Message{
        data: "some data here",
        acknowledger: Broadway.NoopAcknowledger.init()
      }

  @doc """
  Invoked once by Broadway during `Broadway.start_link/2`.

  The goal of this callback is to manipulate the general topology options,
  if necessary at all, and introduce any new child specs that will be
  started **before** the producer's supervisor in Broadway's supervision tree.
  Broadway's supervision tree is a `rest_for_one` supervisor (see the documentation
  for `Supervisor`), which means that if the children returned from this callback
  crash they will bring down the rest of the pipeline before being restarted.

  This callback is guaranteed to be invoked inside the Broadway main process.

  `module` is the Broadway module passed as the first argument to
  `Broadway.start_link/2`. `options` is all of Broadway topology options passed
  as the second argument to `Broadway.start_link/2`.

  The return value of this callback is a tuple `{child_specs, options}`. `child_specs`
  is the list of child specs to be started under Broadway's supervision tree.
  `updated_options` is a potentially-updated list of Broadway options
  that will be used instead of the ones passed to `Broadway.start_link/2`. This can be
  used to modify the characteristics of the Broadway topology to accommodate
  the children started here.

  Invoked by the terminator right before Broadway starts draining in-flight
  messages during shutdown.

  This callback should be implemented by producers that need to do additional
  work before shutting down. That includes active producers like RabbitMQ that
  must ask the data provider to stop sending messages. It will be invoked for
  each producer stage.

  `state` is the current state of the producer.
