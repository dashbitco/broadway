defmodule Broadway.Subscriber do
  # This modules defines conveniences for subscribing to producers
  # and how to resubscribe to them in case of crashes.
  #
  # In practice, only the first layer resubscribers in case of crashes
  # as the remaining ones are shutdown via the supervision tree which
  # is set as one_for_all, with max_restarts of 1. This is done so
  # cancellations model graceful shutdowns exclusively with the help
  # of the terminator.
  #
  # On shutdown:
  #
  #   1. The terminator notifies the first layer that they should no longer resubscribe
  #   2. The terminator tells producers to accumulate demand, flush and shutdown
  #   3. The terminator proceeds to monitor and wait for the termination of the last layer
  #   4. Each layer sees all cancellations from upstream, and cancels downstream via async_info
  #   5. The last layer exits
  #
  # To ensure this is race free:
  #
  #   1. All layers (except the producers) should be one_for_all, permanent, and single max_restarts
  #   2. Therefore, only the first layer (after the producers) resubscribe
  #   3. The upper supervisor should be rest_for_one, permanent, and single max_restarts too
  #   4. The terminator should have a reasonable shutdown child spec timeout
