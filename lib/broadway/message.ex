defmodule Broadway.Message do

  This struct holds all information about a message.

  A message is first created by the producers. It is then
  sent downstream and gets updated multiple times, either
  by a module implementing the `Broadway` behaviour
  through the `c:Broadway.handle_message/3` callback
  or internally by one of the built-in stages of Broadway.

  Instead of modifying the struct directly, you should use the functions
  provided by this module to manipulate messages.

  Defines the message batch key.

  The batch key identifies the batch the message belongs to, within
  a given batcher. Each batcher then groups batches with the same
  `batch_key`, with size of at most `batch_size` within period
  `batch_timeout`. Both `batch_size` and `batch_timeout` are managed
  per batch key, so a batcher is capable of grouping multiple batch
  keys at the same time, regardless of the concurrency level.

  If a given batcher has multiple batch processors (concurrency > 1),
  all messages with the same batch key are routed to the same processor.
  So different batch keys may run concurrently but the same batch key
  is always run serially and in the same batcher processor.

  Sets the batching mode for the message.

  immediately after processing. Note it doesn't mean the batch contains only a single element
  but rather that all messages received from the processor are delivered without waiting.
