defmodule Broadway do
  @moduledoc ~S"""
  Broadway is a concurrent, multi-stage tool for building
  data ingestion and data processing pipelines.

  It allows developers to consume data efficiently from different
  sources, such as Amazon SQS, Apache Kafka, Google Cloud PubSub,
  RabbitMQ and others.

  ## Built-in features

    * Back-pressure - by relying on `GenStage`, we only get the amount
      of events necessary from upstream sources, never flooding the
      pipeline.

    * Automatic acknowledgements - Broadway automatically acknowledges
      messages at the end of the pipeline or in case of errors.

    * Batching - Broadway provides built-in batching, allowing you to
      group messages either by size and/or by time. This is important
      in systems such as Amazon SQS, where batching is the most efficient
      way to consume messages, both in terms of time and cost.

    * Fault tolerance - Broadway pipelines are carefully designed to manage
      failures. Producers are isolated from the rest of the pipeline and
      automatically resubscribe to your data source in case of crashes.
      At the same time, all of your Broadway callbacks are stateless, which
      allows Broadway to handle any errors locally. This provides a stable
      foundation that play well with your producers, regardless if their
      delivery guarantees are at least once, at most once, or exactly once.

    * Graceful shutdown - Broadway integrates with the VM to provide graceful
      shutdown. By starting Broadway as part of your supervision tree, it will
      guarantee all events are flushed once the VM shuts down.

    * Built-in testing - Broadway ships with a built-in test API, making it
      easy to push test messages through the pipeline and making sure the
      event was properly processed.

    * Custom failure handling - Broadway provides a `c:handle_failed/2` callback
      where developers can outline custom code to handle errors. For example,
      if they want to move messages to another queue for further processing.

    * Dynamic batching - Broadway allows developers to batch messages based on
      custom criteria. For example, if your pipeline needs to build
      batches based on the `user_id`, email address, etc, it can be done
      by calling `Broadway.Message.put_batch_key/2`.

    * Ordering and Partitioning - Broadway allows developers to partition
      messages across workers, guaranteeing messages within the same partition
      are processed in order. For example, if you want to guarantee all events
      tied to a given `user_id` are processed in order and not concurrently,
      you can set the `:partition_by` option. See ["Ordering and partitioning"](#module-ordering-and-partitioning).

    * Rate limiting - Broadway allows developers to rate limit all producers in
      a single node by a given number of messages in a time period, allowing
      developers to easily work sources or sinks that cannot cope with a high
      number of requests. See the `:rate_limiting` option for producers in
      `start_link/2`.

    * Metrics - Broadway uses the `:telemetry` library for instrumentation,
      see ["Telemetry"](#module-telemetry) section below for more information.

  ## The Broadway behaviour

  In order to use Broadway, you need to:

    1. Define your pipeline configuration
    2. Define a module implementing the Broadway behaviour

  ### Example

  Broadway is a process-based behaviour, and you begin by
  defining a module that invokes `use Broadway`. Processes
  defined by these modules will often be started by a
  supervisor, and so a `start_link/1` function is frequently
  also defined but not strictly necessary.

      defmodule MyBroadway do
        use Broadway

        def start_link(_opts) do
          Broadway.start_link(MyBroadway,
            name: MyBroadwayExample,
            producer: [
              module: {Counter, []},
              concurrency: 1
            ],
            processors: [
              default: [concurrency: 2]
            ]
          )
        end

        ...callbacks...
      end

  Then add your Broadway pipeline to your supervision tree
  (usually in `lib/my_app/application.ex`):

      children = [
        {MyBroadway, []}
      ]

      Supervisor.start_link(children, strategy: :one_for_one)

  Adding your pipeline to your supervision tree in this way
  calls the default `child_spec/1` function that is generated
  when `use Broadway` is invoked. If you would like to customize
  the child spec passed to the supervisor, you can override the
  `child_spec/1` function in your module or explicitly pass a
  child spec to the supervisor when adding it to your supervision tree.

  The configuration above defines a pipeline with:

    * One producer
    * Two processors

  Here is how this pipeline would be represented:

  ```asciidoc
                       [producer_1]
                           / \
                          /   \
                         /     \
                        /       \
               [processor_1] [processor_2]   <- process each message
  ```

  After the pipeline is defined, you need to implement the `c:handle_message/3`
  callback which will be invoked by processors for each message.

  `c:handle_message/3` receives every message as a `Broadway.Message`
  struct and it must return an updated message.

  ## Batching

  Depending on the scenario, you may want to group processed messages as
  batches before publishing your data. This is common and especially
  important when working with services like AWS S3 and SQS that provide a
  specific API for sending and retrieving batches. This can drastically
  increase throughput and consequently improve the overall performance of
  your pipeline.

  To create batches, define the `:batchers` configuration option:

      defmodule MyBroadway do
        use Broadway

        def start_link(_opts) do
          Broadway.start_link(MyBroadway,
            name: MyBroadwayExample,
            producer: [
              module: {Counter, []},
              concurrency: 1
            ],
            processors: [
              default: [concurrency: 2]
            ],
            batchers: [
              sqs: [concurrency: 2, batch_size: 10],
              s3: [concurrency: 1, batch_size: 10]
            ]
          )
        end

        # ...callbacks...
      end

  The configuration above defines a pipeline with:

    * One producer
    * Two processors
    * One batcher named `:sqs` with two batch processors
    * One batcher named `:s3` with one batch processor

  Here is how this pipeline would be represented:

  ```asciidoc
                       [producer_1]
                           / \
                          /   \
                         /     \
                        /       \
               [processor_1] [processor_2]   <- process each message
                        /\     /\
                       /  \   /  \
                      /    \ /    \
                     /      x      \
                    /      / \      \
                   /      /   \      \
                  /      /     \      \
             [batcher_sqs]    [batcher_s3]
                  /\                  \
                 /  \                  \
                /    \                  \
               /      \                  \
     [batch_sqs_1] [batch_sqs_2]    [batch_s3_1] <- process each batch
  ```

  Additionally, you have to define the `c:handle_batch/4` callback,
  which batch processors invoke for each batch. You can then
  call `Broadway.Message.put_batcher/2` inside `c:handle_message/3` to
  control which batcher the message should go to.

  The batcher receives processed messages and creates batches
  specified by the `batch_size` and `batch_timeout` configuration. The
  goal is to create a batch with at most `batch_size` entries within
  `batch_timeout` milliseconds. Each message goes into a particular batch,
  controlled by calling `Broadway.Message.put_batch_key/2` in
  `c:handle_message/3`. Once a batch is created in the batcher, it is sent
  to a separate process (the batch processor) that will call `c:handle_batch/4`,
  passing the batcher, the batch itself (a list of messages), a `Broadway.BatchInfo`
  struct, and the Broadway context.

  For example, imagine your producer generates integers as `data`.
  You want to route the odd integers to SQS and the even ones to
  S3. Your pipeline would look like this:

      defmodule MyBroadway do
        use Broadway
        import Integer

        alias Broadway.Message

        # ...start_link...

        @impl true
        def handle_message(_, %Message{data: data} = message, _) when is_odd(data) do
          message
          |> Message.update_data(&process_data/1)
          |> Message.put_batcher(:sqs)
        end

        def handle_message(_, %Message{data: data} = message, _) when is_even(data) do
          message
          |> Message.update_data(&process_data/1)
          |> Message.put_batcher(:s3)
        end

        defp process_data(data) do
          # Do some calculations, generate a JSON representation, etc.
        end

        @impl true
        def handle_batch(:sqs, messages, _batch_info, _context) do
          # Send batch of successful messages as ACKs to SQS
          # This tells SQS that this list of messages were successfully processed
        end

        def handle_batch(:s3, messages, _batch_info, _context) do
          # Send batch of messages to S3
        end
      end

  See the [callbacks documentation](#callbacks) for more information on the
  arguments given to each callback and their expected return types.

  ### The default batcher

  Once you define the `:batchers` configuration key for your Broadway pipeline,
  then **all messages get batched**. By default, unless you call
  `Broadway.Message.put_batcher/2`, messages have their batcher set to the
  `:default` batcher. If you don't define configuration for it, Broadway is going
  to raise an error.

  For example, imagine you want to batch "special" messages and handle them differently
  then all other messages. You can configure your pipeline like this:

      defmodule MyBroadway do
        use Broadway

        def start_link(_opts) do
          Broadway.start_link(MyBroadway,
            name: MyBroadwayExample,
            producer: [
              module: {Counter, []},
              concurrency: 1
            ],
            processors: [
              default: [concurrency: 2]
            ],
            batchers: [
              special: [concurrency: 2, batch_size: 10],
              default: [concurrency: 1, batch_size: 10]
            ]
          )
        end

        def handle_message(_, message, _) do
          if special?(message) do
            message
            |> Broadway.Message.put_batcher(:special)
          else
            message
          end
        end

        def handle_batch(:special, messages, _batch_info, _context) do
          # Handle special batch
        end

        def handle_batch(:default, messages, _batch_info, _context) do
          # Handle all other messages in batches
        end

  Now you are ready to get started. See the `start_link/2` function
  for a complete reference on the arguments and options allowed.

  Also makes sure to check out GUIDES in the documentation sidebar
  for more examples, how tos and more.

  ## Acknowledgements and failures

  At the end of the pipeline, messages are automatically acknowledged.

  If there are no batchers, the acknowledgement will be done by processors.
  The number of messages acknowledged, assuming the pipeline is running
  at full scale, will be `max_demand - min_demand`. Since the default values
  are 10 and 5 respectively, we will be acknowledging in groups of 5.

  If there are batchers, the acknowledgement is done by the batchers,
  using the `batch_size`.

  In case of failures, Broadway does its best to keep the failures
  contained and avoid losing messages. The failed message or batch is
  acknowledged as failed immediately. For every failure, a log report
  is also emitted. If your Broadway module also defines the
  `c:handle_failed/2` callback, that callback will be invoked with
  all the failed messages before they get acknowledged.

  Note however, that `Broadway` does not provide any sort of retries
  out of the box. This is left completely as a responsibility of the
  producer. For instance, if you are using Amazon SQS, the default
  behaviour is to retry unacknowledged messages after a user-defined
  timeout. If you don't want unacknowledged messages to be retried,
  is your responsibility to configure a dead-letter queue as target
  for those messages.

  ## Producer concurrency

  Setting producer concurrency is a tradeoff between latency and internal
  queueing.

  For efficiency, you should generally limit the amount of internal queueing.
  Whenever additional messages are sitting in a busy processor's mailbox, they
  can't be delivered to another processor which may be available or become
  available first.

  One possible cause of internal queueing is multiple producers. This is because
  each processor's demand will be sent to all producers. For example, if a
  processor demands `2` messages and there are `2` producers, each producer
  will try to produce `2` messages (for example, by pulling from a queue or
  whatever the specific producer does) and give them to the processor. So the
  processor may receive `max_demand * <producer concurrency>` messages.

  Setting producer `concurrency: 1` will reduce internal queueing. This is
  likely a good choice for producers which take minimal time to produce a
  message, such as `BroadwayRabbitMQ`, which receives messages as they are
  pushed by RabbitMQ and can specify how many to prefetch.

  On the other hand, when using a producer such as `BroadwaySQS` which must
  make a network round trip to fetch from an external source, it may be better
  to use multiple producers and accept some internal queueing to avoid having
  fetch messages whenever there is new demand.

  Measure your system to decide which setting is most appropriate.

  Adding another single-producer pipeline, or another node running the
  pipeline, are other ways you may consider to increase throughput.

  ## Batcher concurrency

  If a batcher's `concurrency` is greater than `1`, Broadway will use as few of
  the batcher processes as possible at any given moment, attempting to satisfy
  the `batch_size` of one batcher process within the `batch_timeout` before
  sending messages to another.

  ## Testing

  Many producers receive data from external systems and hitting the network
  is usually undesirable when running the tests.

  For testing purposes, we recommend developers to use `Broadway.DummyProducer`.
  This producer does not produce any messages by itself and instead the
  `test_message/3` and `test_batch/3` functions should be used to publish
  messages.

  With `test_message/3`, you can push a message into the pipeline and receive
  a process message when the pipeline acknowledges the data you have pushed
  has been processed.

  Let's see an example. Imagine the following `Broadway` module:

      defmodule MyBroadway do
        use Broadway

        def start_link() do
          producer_module = Application.fetch_env!(:my_app, :producer_module)
          producer_options = Application.get_env(:my_app, :producer_options, [])

          Broadway.start_link(__MODULE__,
            name: __MODULE__,
            producer: [
              module: {producer_module, producer_options}
            ],
            processors: [
              default: []
            ],
            batchers: [
              default: [batch_size: 10]
            ]
          )
        end

        @impl true
        def handle_message(_processor, message, _context) do
          message
        end

        @impl true
        def handle_batch(_batcher, messages, _batch_info, _context) do
          messages
        end
      end

  Now in config/test.exs you could do:

      config :my_app,
        producer_module: Broadway.DummyProducer,
        producer_options: [] # change if required for your dev/prod producer

  And we can test it like this:

      defmodule MyBroadwayTest do
        use ExUnit.Case, async: true

        test "test message" do
          ref = Broadway.test_message(MyBroadway, 1)
          assert_receive {:ack, ^ref, [%{data: 1}], []}
        end
      end

  Note that at the end we received a message in the format of:

      {:ack, ^ref, successful_messages, failure_messages}

  You can use the acknowledgment to guarantee the message has been
  processed and therefore any side-effect from the pipeline should be
  visible.

  When using `test_message/3`, the message will be delivered as soon as
  possible, without waiting for the pipeline `batch_size` to be reached
  or without waiting for `batch_timeout`. This behaviour is useful to test
  and verify single messages, without imposing high timeouts to our test
  suites.

  In case you want to test multiple messages, then you need to use
  `test_batch/3`. `test_batch/3` will respect the batching configuration,
  which most likely means you need to increase your test timeouts:

      test "batch messages" do
        ref = Broadway.test_batch(MyBroadway, [1, 2, 3])
        assert_receive {:ack, ^ref, [%{data: 1}, %{data: 2}, %{data: 3}], []}, 1000
      end

  However, keep in mind that, generally speaking, there is no guarantee
  the messages will arrive in the same order that you have sent them,
  especially for large batches, as Broadway will process large batches
  concurrently and order will be lost.

  If you want to send more than one test message at once, then we recommend
  setting the `:batch_mode` to `:bulk`, especially if you want to assert how
  the code will behave with large batches. Otherwise the batcher will flush
  messages as soon as possible and in small batches.

  However, keep in mind that, regardless of the `:batch_mode` you cannot
  rely on ordering, as Broadway pipelines are inherently concurrent. For
  example, if you send those messages:

      test "multiple batch messages" do
        ref = Broadway.test_batch(MyBroadway, [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7], batch_mode: :bulk)
        assert_receive {:ack, ^ref, [%{data: 1}], []}, 1000
      end

  ### Testing with Ecto

  If you are using Ecto in your Broadway processors and you want
  to run your tests concurrently, you need to tell Broadway to
  use the Ecto SQL Sandbox during tests. This can be done in two
  steps.

  First, when you call `test_messages/3` in your tests, include
  the `:ecto_sandbox` process in the message metadata:

      Broadway.test_message(MyApp.Pipeline, message, metadata: %{ecto_sandbox: self()})

  Now we can use Broadway telemetry callbacks to fetch the sandbox
  process and enable it inside the processor. Add to your
  `test/test_helper.exs`:

      defmodule BroadwayEctoSandbox do
        def attach(repo) do
          events = [
            [:broadway, :processor, :start],
            [:broadway, :batch_processor, :start],
          ]

          :telemetry.attach_many({__MODULE__, repo}, events, &__MODULE__.handle_event/4, %{repo: repo})
        end

        def handle_event(_event_name, _event_measurement, %{messages: messages}, %{repo: repo}) do
          with [%Broadway.Message{metadata: %{ecto_sandbox: pid}} | _] <- messages do
            Ecto.Adapters.SQL.Sandbox.allow(repo, pid, self())
          end

          :ok
        end
      end

      BroadwayEctoSandbox.attach(MyApp.Repo)

  And now you should have concurrent Broadway tests that talk to the database.

  ## Ordering and partitioning

  By default, Broadway processes all messages and batches concurrently,
  which means ordering is not guaranteed. Some producers may impose some
  ordering (for instance, Apache Kafka), but if the ordering comes from a
  business requirement, you will have to impose the ordering yourself.
  This can be done with the `:partition_by` option, which enforces that
  messages with a given property are always forwarded to the same stage.

  In order to provide partitioning throughout the whole pipeline, just
  set `:partition_by` at the root of your configuration:

      defmodule MyBroadway do
        use Broadway

        def start_link(_opts) do
          Broadway.start_link(__MODULE__,
            name: __MODULE__,
            producer: [
              module: {Counter, []},
              concurrency: 1
            ],
            processors: [
              default: [concurrency: 2]
            ],
            batchers: [
              sqs: [concurrency: 2, batch_size: 10],
              s3: [concurrency: 1, batch_size: 10]
            ],
            partition_by: &partition/1
          )
        end

        defp partition(msg) do
          msg.data.user_id
        end

  In the example above, we are partitioning the pipeline by `user_id`.
  This means any message with the same `user_id` will be handled by
  the same processor and batch processor.

  The `partition` function must return a non-negative integer,
  starting at zero, which is routed to a stage by using the `remainder`
  option.

  If the data you want to partition by is not an integer, you can
  explicitly hash it by calling `:erlang.phash2/1`. However, note
  that `hash` does not guarantee an equal distribution of events
  across partitions. So some partitions may be more overloaded than
  others, slowing down the whole pipeline.

  In the example above, we have set the same partition for all
  processors and batchers. You can also specify the `:partition_by`
  function for each "processor" and "batcher" individually.

  Most of the events follow the `:telemetry.span/3` convention for measurements.
  This means that "start" events have a `:system_time` representing the start of
  that event using `System.system_time/0`. The "stop" or "exception" events
  have the `duration` value, which is the difference in monotonic time between
  the start and stop events.

  Invoked for preparing messages before handling (if defined).

  It expects:

    * `messages` is a list of `Broadway.Message` structs to be processed.
    * `context` is the user defined data structure passed to `start_link/2`.

  This is the place to prepare and preload any information that will be used
  by `c:handle_message/3`. For example, if you need to query the database,
  instead of doing it once per message, you can do it on this callback as
  a best-effort optimization.

  The length of the list of messages received by this callback is often based
  on the `min_demand`/`max_demand` configuration in the processor but ultimately
  it depends on the producer and on the frequency data arrives. A pipeline that
  receives messages rarely will most likely emit lists of length below the
  `min_demand` value. Producers which are push-based, rather than pull-based,
  such as `BroadwayRabbitMQ.Producer`, are more likely to send messages as they
  arrive (which may skip batching altogether and always be single element lists).
  In other words, this callback is simply a convenience for preparing messages,
  it does not guarantee the messages will be accumulated to a certain length.
  For effective batch processing, see `c:handle_batch/4`.

  This callback must always return all messages it receives, as
  `c:handle_message/3` is still called individually for each message afterwards.

  > #### Failed Messages {: .warning}

  > Even if `c:prepare_messages/2` **fails** some messages (`Broadway.Message.failed/2`),

  Invoked to handle/process individual messages sent from a producer.

  It receives:

    * `processor`  is the key that defined the processor.
    * `message` is the `Broadway.Message` struct to be processed.
    * `context` is the user defined data structure passed to `start_link/2`.

  And it must return the (potentially) updated `Broadway.Message` struct.

  This is the place to do any kind of processing with the incoming message,
  e.g., transform the data into another data structure, call specific business
  logic to do calculations. Basically, any CPU bounded task that runs against
  a single message should be processed here.

  In order to update the data after processing, use the
  `Broadway.Message.update_data/2` function. This way the new message can be
  properly forwarded and handled by the batcher:

      @impl true
      def handle_message(_, message, _) do
        message
        |> update_data(&do_calculation_and_returns_the_new_data/1)
      end

  In case more than one batcher have been defined in the configuration,
  you need to specify which of them the resulting message will be forwarded
  to. You can do this by calling `put_batcher/2` and returning the new
  updated message:

      @impl true
      def handle_message(_, message, _) do
        # Do whatever you need with the data
        ...

        message
        |> put_batcher(:s3)
      end

  Any message that has not been explicitly failed will be forwarded to the next
  step in the pipeline. If there are no extra steps, it will be automatically
  acknowledged.

  In case of errors in this callback, the error will be logged and that particular
  message will be immediately acknowledged as failed, not proceeding to the next
  steps of the pipeline. This callback also traps exits, so failures due to broken
  links between processes do not automatically cascade.

    * `messages` is the list of `Broadway.Message` structs in the incoming batch.
    * `batch_info` is a `Broadway.BatchInfo` struct containing extra information
      about the incoming batch.
    * `context` is the user defined data structure passed to `start_link/2`.

  It must return an updated list of messages. All messages received must be returned,
  otherwise an error will be logged. All messages after this step will be acknowledged
  according to their status.

  are acknowledged according to the producer. This gives you a chance to do something
  with the message before it's acknowledged, such as storing it in an external
  persistence layer or similar.

  For example, in your tests, you may do:

      ref = Broadway.test_message(broadway, 1)
      assert_receive {:ack, ^ref, [successful], []}

  or if you want to override which acknowledger shall be called, you may do:

      acknowledger = fn data, ack_ref -> {MyAck, ack_ref, :ok} end
      Broadway.test_message(broadway, 1, acknowledger: acknowledger)

  Note that messages sent using this function will ignore demand and :transform
  option specified in :producer option in `Broadway.start_link/2`.

  @doc """
  Sends a list of data as a batch of messages to the Broadway pipeline.

  This is a convenience used for testing. Each message is automatically
  wrapped in a `Broadway.Message` with `Broadway.CallerAcknowledger`
  configured to send a message back to the caller once all batches
  have been fully processed.

  If there are more messages in the batch than the pipeline `batch_size`
  or if the messages in the batch take more time to process than
  `batch_timeout` then the caller will receive multiple messages.

  It returns a reference that can be used to identify the ack
  messages.

  See ["Testing"](#module-testing) section in module documentation
  for more information.
